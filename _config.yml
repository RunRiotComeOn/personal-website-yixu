# Extended Bio (shown on home page)
bio_extended: |
  I am an undergraduate student at Fudan University, pursuing my Bachelor's degree
  with a focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning.

  My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs),
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Embodied Intelligence. I am currently working
  under the supervision of [Professor Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) in UC Davis,
  conducting research on Vision-Language Models and their applications.

  Through my research, I aim to advance the understanding of how AI systems can better
  perceive, reason, and interact with the visual world.
