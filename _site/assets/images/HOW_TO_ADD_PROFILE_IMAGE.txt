HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE IMAGE
==============================

To add your profile photo to the website:

1. Prepare your photo:
   - Recommended format: JPG or PNG
   - Recommended dimensions: 600x800 pixels (portrait orientation)
   - Or use aspect ratio 3:4 (e.g., 900x1200px)
   - File size: Keep under 500KB for faster loading

2. Rename your photo to: profile.jpg
   (Or keep the name you prefer and update _config.yml accordingly)

3. Place the file in this folder:
   C:\Users\sophi\Desktop\Personal_website\assets\images\

4. If you used a different filename, update _config.yml:
   profile_image: "/assets/images/your-photo-name.jpg"

5. Restart the Jekyll server (if running) to see changes:
   - Stop: Ctrl+C
   - Start: bundle exec jekyll serve

TIPS:
- Use a professional headshot or portrait photo
- Ensure good lighting and a clean background
- The photo will have a classic "oil painting" frame effect
- On hover, the photo will have a subtle lift animation

ALTERNATIVE:
If you don't have a photo yet, the website will show a placeholder
with instructions. This is perfectly fine for development!
